            I am a UX/UI Designer with a focus on eCommerce and SaaS, and experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe that a strong understanding of UX research,
            data-driven design, and design implementation is essential for delivering products that truly meet users'
            needs. 
            
            <br/><br/> Having strong knowledge and hands-on experience in UX, currently I'm actively
            learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I strive
            to develop products that take into account the user experience, business goals, and technical feasibility.
          </p>
          <p class="body hero__copy">
            As a UX writer, I understand the power of words to shape the user experience. I understand the difference
            between Voice and Tone, and know why "Oopsie!" rarely, if ever, works. I aim to write copy that is clear,
            concise, and engaging so that users can easily understand the benefits of the product. 
             <br/><br/> I am a big believer
            in accessible design principles (WCAG 2.2), making sure that everyone has access to products that are easy
            to use, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

            During his time at Lynk & Co, Iura has worked with all parts of the design process, and always succeeded in an excellent way in combining customer needs with the company's goals. Iura is incredibly empathetic, intelligent, open-minded and very receptive to feedback. He is imbued with a positive attitude and collaborative spirit - a true team player!

               As a senior UX designer at Lynk & Co, I’ve worked closely with Iura for 2 years. I’m really impressed by how much he has grown in his role as UX designer, taking on more and more responsibility and becoming autonomous in his work. Apart from his skills in the field, Iura is also highly sociable and easygoing. Every UX department should have a Iura!

          <p class="body recomendations__body">
             Iurii’s been one of the best students I’ve had the pleasure to teach in my class. Not only he has great analysis skills to design human centered products but also a huge determination to accomplish every goal he has on mind. He has great human values, so it’s really easy to work with him. I’d highly recommend him as a UX/UI Designer.
